          <b>Single-Wall, Round and Flat Oval Duct and Fittings</b><br />
          <p>McGill AirFlow's single-wall, round duct is fabricated to exacting tolerances that make it easy to assemble and essentially leak free. Round duct costs less to install than rectangular duct and because of its efficiency, a round duct system offers lower operating costs. Three standard types of single-wall, round duct are available: spiral lockseam, spiral lockseam with a standing rib, and longitudinal seam.</p>

          <p>For applications in which space restrictions prohibit the use of round duct, McGill AirFlow offers flat oval duct in spiral lockseam and longitudinal seam constructions. Flat oval duct provides a more efficient alternative to rectangular duct in these applications. McGill AirFlow manufactures flat oval duct with the same techniques used to make round duct. As a result, flat oval duct shares many of the performance characteristics of round duct. Compared with rectangular duct, it provides lower installation costs and, because of reduced leakage and pressure loss, lower operating costs.</p>
