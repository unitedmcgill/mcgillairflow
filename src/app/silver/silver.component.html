                    <p>Your customers realize that harmful bacteria can contaminate their HVAC and ventilation systems, threatening the health and safety of everyone in the building. However, potential contamination from destructive microbes is not limited to terrorist attacks, it is a day-to-day concern.</p>
                    <p>Outdoor pollution levels have improved over the past 20 years, but many schools, hospitals, day-care centers, aquatic facilities, and offices have become much tighter buildings with minimal fresh air flow. These buildings retain pollutants at greater levels. If maintenance of the HVAC system is haphazard and moisture is present, bacteria, mold, mildew, and other fungi can thrive.</p>

                    <p>Most of the 300,000 known types of mold are harmless, but scientists are concerned about the potential dangers of exposure to molds that can produce mycotoxins, natural compounds that can cause serious respiratory problems.</p>
                    <p>In response to the rise in asthma and allergies among schoolchildren today, the U.S. EPA has issued new air quality standards to provide additional protection for children and asthmatics. The governor of California has also signed a bill creating the Toxic Mold Protection Act, which sets the toughest toxic mold standards in the nation.</p>
                    <p>With a focus on HVAC systems, members of ASHRAE are studying retrofit programs to improve health and safety in existing buildings, and design features that could be incorporated into new buildings to improve health and safety.</p>
                    <p><b>You Have a Revolutionary New Safeguard</b></p>
                    <p>The first line of defense against destructive microbes is a clean and well-maintained HVAC system with good air distribution.</p>
                    <p>McGill AirFlow's SilverGuard ductwork is a second line of defense in the battle for good indoor air quality (IAQ). SilverGuard antimicrobial ductwork inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, mildew and other fungi on its coated surfaces.  SilverGuard ductwork is the perfect solution for applications where indoor air quality is an issue, such as food preparation facilities, hospitals, day-care centers, nursing homes, and schools. It is ideal for both consumer and industrial installations — anywhere bacteria, mold, and mildew grow.</p>

                    <p>The small amount of moisture present on a table top at ambient conditions is all the moisture needed for microbes to grow — and to cause the antimicrobial compound to begin its work. The zeolite matrix acts as an ion pump, exchanging silver ions with other ions present in moisture. The silver ions penetrate the microbe membrane and prevent RNA/DNA splitting, thereby preventing growth. The ion exchange continues until it reaches a state of equilibrium and does not release additional silver ions until there is a change in the amount of moisture present.</p>

                    <p>SilverGuard ductwork was developed as a second line of defense in the fight against bacteria, mold, mildew and other fungi residing in HVAC duct systems.

                    <p><b>What is the antimicrobial compound?</b></p>
                    <p>The antimicrobial compound is a patented zeolite that encapsulates millions of silver ions. Silver, a natural protective element, has been used for over 6,000 years for food and beverage storage. This proven technology is successful in controlling growth of bacteria, mold, mildew and other fungi.</p>

                <div class="card-text">
                    <p><b>How does the antimicrobial compound work?</b></p>
                    <p>Moisture is the trigger. As little moisture as is present on a table top at ambient conditions is all that is needed for microbes to grow and to cause the antimicrobial compound to work. The zeolite acts as an ion pump exchanging silver ions with other ions (Na+, Ca+, etc.) present in moisture. The ion exchange continues until it reaches a state of equilibrium. The silver ions penetrate the microbe membrane and prevent RNA/DNA splitting, thereby inhibiting growth.</p>

                    <p><b>What type of coating is on the SilverGuard ductwork?</b></p>
                    <p>The antimicrobial compound is incorporated into an epoxy coating which is bonded to the metal surface by heat. Translucent blue pigment is added to the epoxy coating to indicate to what surfaces the compound is applied.</p>

                    <p>The surface of the SilverGuard ductwork may be cleaned with a mild detergent and a soft sponge or cloth, and then air-dried or dried with a soft cloth. Harsh abrasive cleaners must be avoided in order to prevent damage to the epoxy coating.</p>

The silver ions contained within the ceramic matrix can still diffuse and migrate to the microbes within the scratch. The active silver ions can "bridge" up to a 1/4-inch gap. Numerous or wide scratch patterns will reduce the efficacy of the product. Contact the McGill AirFlow sales engineering office nearest you to order SilverGuard ductwork epoxy paint for touch-ups.</p>

Salt spray, water soak and humidity testing has indicated that the antimicrobial benefit will be present as long as the epoxy coating remains on the steel.
